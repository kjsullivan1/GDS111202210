        <p>Hi, I'm Keegan and I'm a residant of NEIT in the video game development and design program. I enjoy reading way too deep into storytelling and finding the smallest details.I enjoy watching football and my favorite team is the Cleveland Browns. They're currently in midseason fighting for a playoff spot in a very tough league this year. My favortie game right now is Persona 5 Royal, however the <a href="https://darksouls.wiki.fextralife.com/Dark+Souls+Wiki" class="btn">Dark Souls</a> series is making a good argument to be in that spot. I entered this program to become a developer, however I like to create stories so I may end up choosing to become a designer. I have a notebook that is getting full of different game ideas.For a while now I have been getting more into the fantasy genre. My girlfriend turned me into a cat person when up until then I was a die-hard dog person. I have a sweet tooth and my favorite snack are oreos.</p>
